-These are all projects that I worked on while attending San Francisco State
University.
-All files were created with Max 7
-All samples were pulled from open source sites and can be altered and
modified manulally.
-For the "Final Project" file you will need to have VSynth plugin installed to
run.
-Have fun :)
